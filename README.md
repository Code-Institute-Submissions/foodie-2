## Known bugs/ issues

 - Had trouble with the upload recipe image function. 
 after extensive search on stack overflow and such I found this video on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsgAuceHha4 and I finally figured it out after many trials and errors.

- Had trouble parsing ObjectId when fetching recipe_id as it was passed in as an object and not a string.
